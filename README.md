# CS 370 Project Two – Q-Learning Maze Solver

## **Overview**
This project focuses on implementing and training an AI agent using the **Q-learning** algorithm to navigate a maze. The goal is for the agent to learn the most efficient path to the exit by balancing exploration and exploitation over many training epochs.

## **Work Completed in This Project**

### **Provided Code**
The starter code included:
- A **QMaze** class used to create the maze environment  
- Initialization of the maze layout  
- Functions to reset the maze  
- Structures for tracking the agent’s **score**, **state**, and **experience**

### **My Contributions**
I implemented the core **Q-training algorithm**. This included:

- Running multiple **training epochs**, each starting with a maze reset  
- Allowing the agent to run the maze repeatedly until it reached the goal  
- Enabling **exploration vs. exploitation** behavior  
- Updating the Q-values so the agent could improve its score and discover faster and more efficient paths  

Through repeated cycles, the AI agent learned to make smarter decisions, gain more points, and complete the maze in fewer steps.

## **What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?**

Computer scientists design and build the technological systems that power our modern world. Their work includes:
- Developing apps, websites, games, and software  
- Creating tools that improve communication and accessibility  
- Building AI systems that assist and enhance user experiences  

Their contributions matter because they solve real-world problems and make everyday tasks easier—for example:
- Video calling family across the world  
- Ordering food or shopping online  
- Using social media to stay connected  
- Accessing AI assistance for learning, entertainment, or productivity  

Computer scientists play a critical role in shaping how we interact with technology.

## **How I Approach Problems as a Computer Scientist**

When faced with a problem, I follow a structured approach:

1. **Define and understand the problem clearly**  
   Identifying the goal ensures that my solution is focused and effective.

2. **Break the problem into smaller, manageable pieces**  
   This reduces complexity and makes it easier to implement.

3. **Develop, test, and evaluate potential solutions**  
   Testing helps confirm that the chosen approach works and meets requirements.

4. **Reflect and improve**  
   After solving the problem, I analyze the process, what I learned, and how I can apply the same techniques to future challenges.

## **Ethical Responsibilities to Users and Organizations**

As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to:

- Write safe and secure code  
- Protect user privacy and handle data responsively  
- Follow legal requirements and organizational policies  
- Consider the user impact of the systems I build  
- Ensure technology is designed responsibly and does not harm users  

Ethics are essential to building trust and maintaining the integrity of both the project and the organization.

## **Conclusion**
This project helped me understand Q-learning on a deeper level and apply AI concepts in a real programming environment. Completing the training algorithm and watching the agent improve over time gave me hands-on experience with reinforcement learning, problem-solving, and responsible system design.
