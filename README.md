For this Project, I was responsible for implementing the Q-training algorithm used by the AI agent to learn how to navigate the maze.
The starter code provided the structure of the project, including:

The QMaze class

Maze initialization and its environment

Storage for the agent’s score and experience

Basic functions to reset and display the maze

My contribution was completing the Q-learning logic.
This included:

Running multiple epochs where the maze resets each time

Enabling the agent to repeatedly attempt the maze until it reaches the goal

Implementing the balance between exploration (trying new paths) and exploitation (using what it has learned)

Updating Q-values so the agent could improve its score and discover the fastest route through the maze

Through repeated training runs, the AI learned to make better decisions, earn more reward points, and complete the maze more efficiently.

What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists design and build the technology that people use every day—applications, games, websites, artificial intelligence tools, operating systems, and much more.

Their work matters because it solves real-world problems and makes life easier. For example:

Apps that let us call family members across the world

Online shopping platforms and food delivery websites

Social media that connects communities

AI systems that assist users, provide help, or enhance digital experiences

Computer scientists develop systems that improve productivity, communication, entertainment, and accessibility. Their contributions impact nearly every industry.

How I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist

When solving problems, I follow a structured process:

Understand and define the problem clearly
This ensures I know exactly what needs to be solved before writing any code.

Break the problem down into smaller tasks
This makes it easier to manage and reduces complexity.

Develop and test solutions
I experiment with different approaches and use appropriate testing methods to check functionality.

Reflect and refine
After solving the problem, I evaluate what worked, what didn’t, and how I can apply the experience to future projects for myself or for peers.

My Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization

As a computer scientist, I must:

Write safe, secure, and reliable code

Protect user privacy and ensure data is handled responsibly

Follow laws, policies, and organizational standards

Consider how people will use the systems I build and design them responsibly

Ensure that my work does not harm users and supports a positive, safe experience

Ethical responsibility means keeping the user’s trust, protecting their information, and developing technology that benefits them rather than putting them at risk.
